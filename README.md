# react-native-pathjs-charts-expo

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-pathjs-charts-expo.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-pathjs-charts-expo)

This library is a cross-platform (iOS/Android) library of charts/graphs originally using [react-native-svg](https://github.com/magicismight/react-native-svg) and [paths-js](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js) but ported to use [expo](https://github.com/expo/expo) for the svg part.

This project is based on the now archived at version 0.0.34 of [react-native-pathjs-charts](https://github.com/capitalone/react-native-pathjs-charts)

Components include Bar charts, Smoothline charts, Stockline charts, Scatterplots, Tree graphs and Radar graphs.
